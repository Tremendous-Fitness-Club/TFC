    Fat Loss Plan
</h2>
<h3>
    1. Diet
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Diet plays an important role in fat loss. This does not mean you should completely cut your calories and survive on very little. The body takes a few days to adapt to a calorie deficit, and after that, the situation becomes stagnant. However, fat loss is easier today because, by understanding how the body reacts in different situations, we can effectively lose fat without losing muscle.
</p>
<h4>
    1.1 Kind Of Meals
</h4>
<p>
    There are two types of nutrients in meals: <strong>macronutrients</strong> and <strong>micronutrients</strong>. 
    <br><br>
    Macronutrients include:
    <ul>
        <li>Carbohydrates</li>
        <li>Proteins</li>
        <li>Fats</li>
    </ul>
    Micronutrients include:
    <ul>
        <li>Vitamins</li>
        <li>Minerals</li>
    </ul>
    Micronutrients do not provide calories, while macronutrients do. Caloric values:
    <ul>
        <li>1g of carbohydrates = 4 calories</li>
        <li>1g of protein = 4 calories</li>
        <li>1g of fat = 9 calories</li>
    </ul>
    You don’t need to consume as much fat and protein compared to carbohydrates. A general daily ratio could be:
    <ul>
        <li>85% carbohydrates</li>
        <li>10% protein</li>
        <li>5% fat</li>
    </ul>
    Protein is hard to digest; consuming too much can make you feel stuffed. Excess fat does not increase metabolism, which is crucial for adapting to calorie intake. This is why drastically increasing or cutting calories is often ineffective—metabolism adjusts over time.
</p>
<h4>
    1.2 Importance Of Timing
</h4>
<p>
    By applying different dietary techniques at different times, you can maintain a metabolism that burns fat automatically—until you choose to stop. Incorporating intermittent fasting also helps. It boosts metabolism, slows aging, and offers many other benefits.
    <br><br>
    The <strong>16:8</strong> intermittent fasting plan is the most effective for most people. Others use <strong>18:6</strong>, <strong>20:4</strong>, or even <strong>one meal a day</strong>. In the 16:8 method, you can have three well-balanced meals with two 4-hour breaks between them.
</p>

<h3>
    2. Exercise
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Exercise is not just the key to getting lean—it's a biological requirement. For example, if someone locks you in a room, you'll realize after a few hours that your body needs water. After a day or so, you'll crave food. Similarly, your body eventually realizes it needs physical activity, though it might take years to notice the absence.
</p>
<h4>
    2.1 Kind Of Exercise
</h4>
<p>
    There are mainly two types of exercise:
    <ul>
        <li>Weight training (e.g., barbell, dumbbell)</li>
        <li>Cardio (e.g., running, cycling)</li>
    </ul>
    I always recommend weight training for clients looking to lose fat. Relying solely on cardio for fat loss is ineffective. Combining cardio with calorie restriction often pushes the body into survival mode, slowing metabolism and conserving fat.
</p>
<h4>
    2.2 High Intensity Training
</h4>
<p>
    In this method, you lift heavy weights according to your capacity for short durations. You cannot lose fat by overexerting yourself daily in the gym—it’s the same mistake as overdoing cardio. My clients typically train for just 30 minutes per day, but with high intensity.
</p>
<h4>
    2.3 Time Table
</h4>
<p>
    One routine doesn’t work for everyone. While many people transform by training selected muscle groups four times a month using a three-day-a-week routine, that approach doesn't suit everyone. I design routines where clients train their selected muscle groups three times a month—and the results are outstanding.
</p>

    Bulk Up Plan
</h2>
<h3>
    1. Exercise
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    To bulk up healthily, you need to train your muscles with weights. This helps increase muscle size and strength. Without it, most of your weight gain will go to your belly as fat.
</p>
<h4>
    1.1 Kinds Of Exercise
</h4>
<p>
    Avoid cardio exercises like running or cycling. Instead, focus on weight training to strengthen your muscles. Do not get frustrated if you don’t immediately see size gains. Initially, muscle strength, bone density, and weight will increase. Size gains come after.
</p>
<h4>
    1.2 High Intensity Training
</h4>
<p>
    In high-intensity training, you train your muscles with heavy weights, according to your capacity, for a short period. Training for too long reduces intensity, which is essential for muscle growth.
</p>
<h4>
    1.3 Time Table
</h4>
<p>
    Most people follow a three-day-a-week program and train their muscle groups four times a month. However, I train my clients' selected muscle groups three times a month with high intensity, and their results are excellent.
</p>

<h3>
    2. Diet
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    To bulk up, you need to eat properly. Have three good meals a day along with at least two snacks to support your gains.
</p>
<h4>
    2.1 Kind of Meals
</h4>
<p>
    Meals include two types of nutrients: <strong>macronutrients</strong> and <strong>micronutrients</strong>.
    <br><br>
    Macronutrients:
    <ul>
        <li>Carbohydrates (1g = 4 calories)</li>
        <li>Proteins (1g = 4 calories)</li>
        <li>Fats (1g = 9 calories)</li>
    </ul>
    Micronutrients:
    <ul>
        <li>Vitamins</li>
        <li>Minerals</li>
    </ul>
    You primarily need carbohydrates for muscle growth. Contrary to popular belief, muscles are not mostly protein—they're mostly water. The word "carbohydrate" includes "hydrate," referring to water. When carbohydrates are stored in muscles as glycogen, they chemically bind to and hold about 3g of water per gram.
    <br><br>
    If you reduce carbohydrates and increase fat intake during high-intensity training, your muscles lose glycogen—and with it, water. As a result, you lose weight instead of gaining.
</p>
<h4>
    2.2 Dirty Bulking vs Healthy Bulking
</h4>
<p>
    Healthy bulking doesn’t just mean setting a calorie limit to avoid fat gain. It’s about knowing what to eat and what to avoid. Dirty bulking ignores this concept.
    <br><br>
    To grow your muscles effectively, you must follow a healthy bulking plan. As mentioned earlier, ensure you include adequate carbohydrates in your diet.
