    <h3>
        1. Diet
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Diet is play an important role in fat loss, this not mean you totally cut your calories and start living on very
        few calories because few days are required by the body to adapt this thing and after that body's situation
        become same.But today fat loss is easy, by understanding how body reacts on different situations we can easily understand
        that how efficiently we lose our fat without losing any muscle.
    </p>
    <h4>
        1.1 Kind Of Meals
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are two type of nutrients which you take from meals i.e. micro nutrients and macro nutrients.carbs, protein and fat are the type of macro nutrients. vitamins, minerals etc. which are not provide any calories to the body are known as micro nutrients. but macro nutrients provide calories. in which 1gm of carbs contain 4 calories, 1gm of protein contain 4 calories and 1gm of fat contain 9 calories. you don't need to eat fat and protein as compared to carbs which means take 85% carbs, 10% protein and 5% fat in
        a day because protein is difficult to digest, if one take more protein then he feels that he is stuffed. and taking more fat is not giving any means because it do not increase the metabolism of the body which is
        responsible to adapt the amount of calories consumed. that's why immediately increase or cutting your calories
        is not meaningful because after some time metabolism adapt it.
    </p>
    <h4>
        1.2 Importance Of Timing
    </h4>
    <p>
        By using some techniques of taking different diets on different times you can maintain a metabolism which
        automatically burns fat until you don't want to stop it. and using intermittent fasting too with it. because it helps in boosting your metabolism, slow your aging and
        provide many more benefits to you. 16 : 8 is best intermittent fasting plan for most people, many doing 18 : 6, 20 : 4 and one meal a day. but in
        16 : 8 you can eat three good meals in a day by implementing two breaks of 4hrs among the meals.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Exercise
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Exercise is not just only a key to get lean but it is a requirement of the body similarly if someone locks you in a room, after few hours you realise that your body requires water and after one and a half day you realise that your body requires food. same thing happen in the case of exercise, it takes years to realise you that something is missing.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2.1 Kind Of Exercise
    </h4>
    <p>
        majorly there are two types of exercise fist in which you lift weights like barbell, dumbbell etc. and second in which you do cardio like running, cycling etc. i always suggest weight training to my clients who wants to lose their fat because doing cardio to lose fat seems doesn't mean in their fat loss programm, by doing cardio and cut down your calories makes your body to switch on its survival mode to slow down metabolism and saves fat to burn.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2.2 High Intensity Training
    </h4>
    <p>
        in this weight training you need to lift heavy weights according to your capacity for a short period. how can a person lose its fat by making himself sick everyday in the gym because it makes the same mistake which happens in doing cardio with the object to lose fat. my clients hardly train 30 minutes in day with intensity.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2.3 Time Table
    </h4>
    <p>
        it is not possible that one kind of exercise routine works for all, it is true that today most people transform themselves by train their selected muscule groups four times in a month with three days a week routine but in case of many people it doesnt work, so i make an ideal routine for my clients in which they train their selected muscle groups three times in a month and the results are tremendous.

    <h3>
        1 Exercise
    </h3>
     <hr>
    <p>
        for getting healthy bulk you need to need to train your muscles with weights to grow your muscles bigger and stronger otherwise you get most of the fat in your belly.
    </p>
    <h4>
        1.1 Kinds Of Exercise
    </h4>
    <p>
        avoid cardio exercise like running, cycling etc. and do weight training to make strongr your muscles, do not get frustated if you do not see any increase in your size because first your muscle strength, bone density and weight get increase. after that you see results in your body size.
    </p>
    <h4>
        1.2 High Intensity Training
    </h4>
    <p>
        under this training you need to train your muscles with heavy weights according to your capacity for a short period to stimulate muscle growth, because if you train long you cannot maintain the intensity which requires to stimulate your muscle growth.
    </p>
    <h4>
        1.3 Time Table
    </h4>
    <p>
        today most people goes with three days a week programm to train their selected muscle groups four times in a month but i trained my clients's selected muscles groups three times in a month with HIGH INTENSITY training and their results are tremendous.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2 Diet
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        you need to eat properly to get bulk, take three good meals a day with two snacks at least to maintain the increase. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        2.1 Kind of meals
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are two type of nutrients which you take from meals i.e. micro nutrients and macro nutrients.carbs, protein and fat are the type of macro nutrients. vitamins, minerals etc. which are not provide any calories to the body are known as micro nutrients. but macro nutrients provide calories. in which 1gm of carbs contain 4 calories, 1gm of protein contain 4 calories and 1gm of fat contain 9 calories. you only need to carbs to grow your muscles because muscle is not mostly protein, it's mostly water, look at the word carbohydrate the suffix hydrate means water, as you all know that when carbohydrate store in the muscle it becomes a chain of sugar molucle called glycogen chemically bonds with and holds 3 grams of water. and when you lower your carb down and increase your fat intake in HIGH INTENSITY training programm, you burn your glycogen down from the muscles. so instead gain you lose weight.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2.2 Dirty Bulking vs Healthy Bulking
    </h4>
    <p>
        healthy bulking not means to decide a limit of calories for preventing fat stored in gut, but its all about to know what to eat and what not, and opposite thing happen in dirty bulking. so you understand you need to goes with healthy bulking to grow your muscles. as i already mention in previous point about carbs, include carbs in your routine.
